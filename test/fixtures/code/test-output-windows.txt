 âœ— [Medium] NoRateLimitingForExpensiveWebOperation
     Path: sample-project/goof/routes/index.js, line 77
     Info: This endpoint handler performs a system command execution and does not use a rate-limiting mechanism. It may enable the attackers to perform Denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a rate-limiting middleware such as express-limit.

 âœ— [High] Sqli
     Path: sample-project/goof/routes/index.js, line 39
     Info: Unsanitized input from the HTTP request body flows into find, where it is used in an SQL query. This may result in an SQL Injection vulnerability.

 âœ— [High] CommandInjection
     Path: sample-project/goof/routes/index.js, line 86
     Info: Unsanitized input from the HTTP request body flows into child_process.exec, where it is used to build a shell command. This may result in a Command Injection vulnerability.

 âœ— [High] XSS
